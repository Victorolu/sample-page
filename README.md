# Project Base

This project was built using React with the use of component based architecture to achieve the required sample page.

Bootstrap 5.3.2 and react boostrap were used for creating components and styling.

Styling was also done using SCSS files which were imported into their related components.

Icons used in this project were provided using bootstrap icon.

Finally, I made use of Rajdhani Font for text font of the page as that was the closest I could find to sample page.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
